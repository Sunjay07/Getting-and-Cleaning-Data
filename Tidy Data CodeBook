Data source
This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made available by the ‘CENTER for MACHINE LEARNING and INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS’ at the University of California, Irvine.

Data Set Information
These experiments have been carried out on a group of 30 volunteers. Their age varies from 19 years to 48 years. Each person performed six activities, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING; wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the data on 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. These experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers have been selected for creating the training dataset and 30% of the volunteers will form the testing dataset.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and subsequent samples taken in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, were separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components and a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Attribute Information:
For each record in the dataset, the following is provided:
•	Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
•	Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
•	A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
•	Its activity label.
•	An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Section 1: Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in
•	features.txt
•	activity_labels.txt
•	subject_train.txt
•	x_train.txt
•	y_train.txt
•	subject_test.txt
•	x_test.txt
•	y_test.txt
Assign the names to the column and merge to create one data set.

Section 2:Extract only the measurements on the mean & standard deviation
Once the two data sets have been merged, we extract the value of mean and standard deviation only.
Furthermore, we reduce the features set to ensure that the data set has the desired format.
After setting .
We will add two columns –subject and activity and remove the various unwanted columns from the mergedData table.

Section 3. Feature Selection
 The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).
The reasoning behind my selection of features is that the assignment explicitly states "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." To be complete, I included all variables having to do with mean or standard deviation.
In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
•	tBodyAcc-XYZ
•	tGravityAcc-XYZ
•	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyGyro-XYZ
•	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
•	tBodyAccMag
•	tGravityAccMag
•	tBodyAccJerkMag
•	tBodyGyroMag
•	tBodyGyroJerkMag
•	fBodyAcc-XYZ
•	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
•	fBodyGyro-XYZ
•	fBodyAccMag
•	fBodyAccJerkMag
•	fBodyGyroMag
•	fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:
•	mean(): Mean value
•	std(): Standard deviation
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
•	gravityMean
•	tBodyAccMean
•	tBodyAccJerkMean
•	tBodyGyroMean
•	tBodyGyroJerkMean
Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
Note: features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
The resulting variable names are of the following form: tbodyaccmeanx, which means the mean value of tBodyAcc-XYZ.

Section 4: Dataset Activities
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, replace the 1-6 numbers in data_set_3$activity with appropriate names of activity according to “activity_labels.txt”

Section 5: Label the Dataset
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1.	Extract the old names of variables from the merged data set
2.	Use regular expressions and “sub()” function to update the names to more descriptive ones
3.	Replace the variables’ names with the updated vector of names in the merged data set

Section 6 Create an Independent TIDY Dataset
Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
1.	Melt the merged data set with the id of “subject” and “activity”
2.	Then “dcast()“ the melted data where as calculating the mean of each variables in the data set
3.	Write the latest data set to a txt file called "clean-data-set-with-averages-for-each-sub-each-act.txt”
